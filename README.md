This project explores stock market price prediction using machine learning and sentiment analysis. It leverages an LSTM model for price prediction, incorporates sentiment analysis for market understanding, and provides backtesting capabilities with a user-friendly interface.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into three phases:

**Phase 1: Stock Price Prediction with LSTM**

*   Utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict stock market prices.
*   Data preprocessing techniques are employed to prepare historical stock data for the LSTM model.
*   Model training and evaluation are performed to assess the predictive accuracy of the LSTM network.

**Phase 2: Sentiment Analysis**

*   Integrates sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment from news articles, social media, or other textual data.
*   Sentiment scores are calculated and incorporated into the stock prediction process to potentially improve accuracy.  *(Optional: Explain the source of your sentiment data)*

**Phase 3: Backtesting and UI**

*   Develops a backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of the trading strategies generated by the combined LSTM and sentiment analysis models.
*   A user interface (UI) is provided to visualize stock price charts, along with buy and sell signals generated by the backtesting process. *(Optional: Mention the UI framework used, e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Streamlit, etc.)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your_repository_name
    ```

3.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

4.  Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

5.  Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  **(Data Acquisition):**  *(Explain how to obtain the stock data.  Mention the source, format, and any specific requirements.  If you have sample data included, mention that too.)*  Example:  "Stock data is obtained from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.  Sample data is provided in the `data` directory."

2.  **(Model Training):** *(Provide instructions on how to train the LSTM model.  Mention any configuration options or hyperparameters.)* Example: "To train the LSTM model, run the `train_lstm.py` script: `python train_lstm.py`"

3.  **(Sentiment Analysis):** *(Explain how to perform sentiment analysis. Include any specific steps or scripts.)* Example: "The `analyze_sentiment.py` script performs sentiment analysis.  Ensure that your sentiment data source is configured correctly."

4.  **(Backtesting and UI):** *(Describe how to run the backtesting and UI components.)* Example: "Run the `backtest_ui.py` script to start the backtesting process and launch the user interface: `python backtest_ui.py`"
