This project explores automated trading strategies using machine learning.  It currently focuses on implementing and evaluating various algorithmic approaches, with the potential for future expansion to include sentiment analysis and other advanced techniques.

## Project Overview

This project is currently focused on developing and testing different algorithmic trading strategies.  It includes:

*   **Data Handling:**  Tools for loading, processing, and preparing financial data.
*   **Strategy Implementation:** Implementations of various trading strategies (e.g., moving averages, RSI, etc.).
*   **Backtesting Framework:** A framework for backtesting and evaluating the performance of trading strategies.
*   **Performance Metrics:**  Calculation and analysis of key performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, drawdown).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/syed0wais/algobot.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/syed0wais/algobot.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd algobot
    ```

3.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv  # Or python -m venv .venv
    ```

4.  Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

5.  Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Stock data is currently fetched directly within the individual strategy scripts using the `yfinance` library.  You'll need to specify the ticker symbol within the script.  *(Consider adding a central data loading module in the future.)*

2.  **Running a Strategy:** Each strategy is implemented in its own Python file (e.g., `moving_average.py`, `rsi_strategy.py`).  To run a specific strategy, execute the corresponding script:

    ```bash
    python3 sentiment.py  # Example
    python3 app.py      # Example
    ```

    You may need to modify the parameters within each script (e.g., ticker symbol, moving average periods, RSI periods) to customize the backtest.

3.  **Analyzing Results:** The output of each strategy script will typically include performance metrics and potentially charts (if you've added visualization).  *(Consider adding more robust reporting and visualization in the future.)*
